# Classification-Analysis

#### PROPOSAL OF QUESTION
What are the major predictors influencing the initial administration among patients?

#### DEFINE GOAL
The primary goal of this analysis is to identify key predictors. The aim is to determine the variables that significantly influence in predicting the initial administration method. This analysis also aims to understand the relationship between various demographic, medical history and medical conditions and the initial administration of patients. 

#### EXPLANATION OF CLASSIFICATION METHOD
For this analysis, I am using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). KNN is an intuitive classification algorithm that operates based on the principle of similarity, and those similar things are close to each other. It assumes that data points with similar features tend to belong to the same class or have similar output values.
For a given data point, KNN finds the K nearest neighbors to that point based on a distance metric. In classification tasks, the class of a new data point is determined by a majority vote among its K nearest neighbors. The expected outcome of my analysis is to leverage the similarity of data points to predict new and unseen data points.

#### SUMMARY OF METHOD ASSUMPTION
KNN assumes that proximity in the feature space corresponds to similarity in the target variable. This implies that if two data points are close to each other in the feature space, they are likely to belong to the same class. 

#### RESULTS & IMPLICATIONS
The classification analysis provides valuable insights into the relationship between patient demographics and initial administration. However, the poor performance of the model underscores the need for continued research to develop more accurate predictive models.
The classification model exhibits a relatively low accuracy, training accuracy, testing accuracy, and AUC. This indicates that the model’s ability to predict the initial administration among patients based on the provided features is limited. These metrics suggest that it struggles to effectively distinguish between different classes and generalize well to new and unseen data. 
The suboptimal performance of the classification model highlights the need for further model refinement. This may involve refining the feature set, exploring different modeling techniques, or incorporating domain expertise to better capture the complexities of patient demographics and medical conditions. Additionally, collecting additional relevant features or refining existing features could improve the model’s ability to discriminate between different classes. 
The limitations of the classification model have important clinical implications. Healthcare professionals rely on accurate predictive models to make informed decisions about patient care. A model with poor predictive performance could lead to incorrect decisions. 

#### LIMITATION
One limitation of the analysis is the class imbalance in the target variable, specifically the distribution of initial administration classes. In this analysis, Class 0 has 2504 instances, Class 1 has 5060 instances, and Class 2 has 2436. This imbalance can pose challenges during training and evaluation. 
The imbalanced class distribution can lead to be biased toward the majority class (Class 1). As a result, the model may prioritize accuracy on the majority class while neglecting the minority classes, leading to poor predictive performance for those classes. 
Imbalanced data can also hinder the model’s ability to generalize well, as seen in this analysis. the model may struggle to learn meaningful patterns associated with minority classes due to their limited representation in the dataset. 

#### COURSE OF ACTION
Based on the results and implications of the classification analysis, I would not recommend this model to identify the key predictors for initial administration for patients. 
My recommendation for the organization is to first address the significant class imbalance in the dataset. The organization should collect more data for the minority classes to achieve a more balanced distribution. This can involve targeted data collection effects to increase the representation of minority classes. 
Moreover, the organization should implement a system for continuous monitoring and improvement of the classification model. It is essential to regularly update the model with new data, reevaluate its performance, and refine its features as needed to ensure its effectiveness.
